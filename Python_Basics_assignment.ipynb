        "\n",
        "--> Simple and readable: - Python is very easy to be learned and read. As most of the keywords and the commands that are used in English language itself and are easy to understand the meaning of the keyword from the words itself.\n",
        "\tObject Oriented and Procedural Programming: - Python supports both object oriented and procedural programming paradigms, offering various functions and flexibility to the users to use the code in any way they want.\n",
        "\n",
        "-->Number of libraries: - There are a lot number of libraries that python have and make the work easy for the users to achieve the task that they are using and writing the code for.\n",
        "\n",
        "-->\tCross platform: - Python can be used in every platform despite of being Windows, macOS and even in Linux too.\n",
        "\n",
        "--> Open Source: - Being open source, python encourages large community involvement, allowing everyone despite of any age group or any knowledge to continuously work on improving the language and offering support.\n",
        "\n",
        "-->Embeddable and Extensible: - Python is embeddable, allowing developer to include Python code within code written in other language.\n",

        "2.\tDescribe the role of predefined keywords in Python and provide examples of how they are used in a program.\n",
        "\n",
        "--> Python keywords are reserved words that hold a specific meaning in the language and are used in the code/ program to achieve an output or give some meaning to the code so that the output can be achieved. Python keywords are basically used to define something in a code/program so that the system have an idea what needs to be done.\n",

        "Examples: - Lists, dictionaries, sets.\n",
