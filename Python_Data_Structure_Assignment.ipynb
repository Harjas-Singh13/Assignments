        "\n",
        " --> String Slicing in Python is a technique used to extract a portion of a string by specifying a range of indices which will help in obtaining substrings from a given string efficiently.\n",
        " The basic syntax of slicing is as follows:-\n",
        " string[start:stop:step]\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "*   start: The starting index of the slice(It is included)\n",
        "*   stop: The ending index of the slice (exclusive)\n",
        "*   step: The step size or stride between indices (optional).\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: Extracting a Substring:\n",
        "\n",
        "        text = \"Hello World!\"\n",
        "        print(text[0:5])\n",
        "In this example, the slice [0:5] extracts the substring from index 0 to 4.\n",
        "\n",
        "        text = \"Hello World!\"\n",
        "        print(text[0:-3])\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the slice [0:-3] extracts the substring from the end point to the starting.\n",

        "  \n",
        "  --> In Python, a list is a collection of items that are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values. Lists are created using squared brackets and can contain items of any data type.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Following are some of the key features of List in Python:-  \n",
        "\n",
        "  a.) Ordered:- Elements maintain the order in which they are added. There is no changes even if there is a duplicate element that gets added.\n",
        "\n",
        "  b.) Mutable: Lists can be modified, allowing for changes in elements, addition, or removal.\n",
        "\n",
        "  c.) Dynamic Size: Lists can grow and shrink in size, allowing for flexible storage.\n",
        "\n",
        "  d.) Heterogeneous: Lists can contain elements of different data types (e.g., integers, strings, objects).\n",
        "  \n",
        "  e.) Indexing and Slicing: Elements can be accessed via zero-based indexing and can be sliced to create sublists.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  f.) Built-in Methods: Python provides numerous built-in methods for list manipulation, such as append(), extend(), insert(), remove(), pop(), and sort().\n",
        "  \n",
        "  g.) Comprehensions: List comprehensions allow for concise creation and transformation of lists.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  h.) Nested Lists: Lists can contain other lists, enabling the creation of multi-dimensional arrays.\n",
        "\n",
        "  i.) Iterable: Lists can be iterated over using loops, allowing easy access to each element.\n",

        "  --> **Accessing Elements in Lists**:- The elements in the lists using indexing. Python uses zero based indexing which stands that the first element will be stored at 0 index.\n",
        "\n",
        "  For example:-\n",
        "\n",
        "  #List defined\n",

        "   **Modifying Elements in Lists**:- Elements can be modified by assigning a new value to a specific index.\n",

        "\n",
        "      Using immutable keys ensures the integrity of the data structure. Once a key is set, it cannot be changed, which prevents accidental modifications that could lead to data inconsistencies.\n",

        "      Example:\n",

        "          my_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}\n",
        "          # You cannot change 'name' to something else; you can only modify the value\n",
        "          my_dict['name'] = 'Bob'  # Allowed\n",
        "          # But you cannot do this:\n",
        "          # my_dict['name'][0] = 'C'  # Raises TypeError since strings are immutable\n",

        "        Only hashable types (like strings, numbers, and tuples) can be used as dictionary keys. This allows developers to create complex keys using immutable collections.\n",
